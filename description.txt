Makes every enemy in the game into a "worm" type enemy. 

Config support for:
- Allowing Town NPCs, Critters, and/or invincible NPCs to become worms
- Increasing worm segment defense (piercing destroys them)
- Increasing/Decreasing the amount of segments each NPC grows (default 10). Set this to 0 if the segments are causing issues for a specific boss.
- Making the segments invincible and/or deal no damage

Segments glitch a bit when the NPC's sprite uses multiple columns, but it doesn't affect the hitbox I think.

...and yes, existing worm enemies also "become" worms...
